# insert ai

Simple program to stream output from openai api as installable command. Used in my custom nvim config for custom gen ai interface.

I dont like programming with ai but there are some specific things I would rather have it do than me. So I have added a custom neovim plugin to give me a very non intrusive way interface for gen ai in my editor.
