# insert ai

Simple program to stream output from openai api as installable command. Used in my custom nvim config for custom gen ai interface.

I dont like programming with ai but if i have to its on my terms (ai code editors are off limits). So I have added a custom neovim plugin to give me a very non intrusive way interface for gen ai in my editor.
